# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues privately.

Preferred: GitHub Security Advisories
1. Go to the repository **Security** tab.
2. Click **Report a vulnerability**.
3. Provide steps to reproduce and impact details.

If you cannot use GitHub Advisories, open a private discussion with maintainers
through GitHub and mark it as security-sensitive.

## Response Targets

- We aim to acknowledge reports within 7 days.
- We will share a remediation plan or status update as soon as possible.

## Supported Versions

We support the latest `main` branch. If you need a fix for a prior release,
please include that in your report.
